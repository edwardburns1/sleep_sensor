Got into bed around 11 pm and then read for 30-45 min. Then tried to fall asleep, but couldn't. After
about 30 minutes of tossing and turning, I got up, did 20 pushups and took a melatonin. Then fell asleep
shortly thereafter. At some point in the night, I was woken up by birds outside my window, got up to close
my window, and then fell asleep again. I woke up at 8am.

Sleep quality: 4
