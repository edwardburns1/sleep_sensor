Went to bed around 10:45. Took a unisom tablet to try to reset my sleep schedule and woke up at 8am.
Unfortunately, this did not work, and I had anxiety related heart palpitations that kept me up. I powerered
through and did not check my phone at all. I got up several times during the night to try to do pushups
or anything that might tire me out and reduce my anxiety. Eventually, I did pass out, although I have no idea
when. However, when I did finally fall asleep, the sleep was extremely restful and enjoyable. I woke up around
8am, but went back to bed shortly thereafter to catch up on sleep, and try to heal by body some more. I ultimately
woke up at 11am, and decided to get out of bed at around 11:45am.
