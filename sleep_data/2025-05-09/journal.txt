After not sleeping well the previous night, I tried to fill my day with activities to exhaust me. I went
surfing, got dinner with my friends, went to Kate Sessions park, cheered on my roommate at his sports game, and
even went on a date in the late evening. Despite all of this, I still could not fall asleep quickly. It's almost
like my body was in some anxiety induced overdrive, where my body was exhausted but my mind was completely fresh.
