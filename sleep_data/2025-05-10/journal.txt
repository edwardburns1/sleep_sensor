I got into bed around 10:30 to watch TV. I tried going to sleep around 12:30, but after 30 minutes of tossing
and turning, I decided to take a sleeping pill (Unisom) since I had been sleeping so poorly the last couple of days and
really wanted to get some much-needed long rest. The pill worked like a charm, I fell asleep shortly thereafter
and then slept until 12:30 the next day.

Sleep quality: 9
Sleep incidence: 30 min
