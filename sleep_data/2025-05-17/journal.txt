I went to bed around 12:15, read for a period of time, and then shut off the lights. It took a while for me
to fall asleep. I got up several times to adjust my fan. Eventually, I fell asleep, probably after more than an
hour. I woke up (by alarm) at 9:30, but I didn't get out of bed full until 10:20.
