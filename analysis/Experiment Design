5 Total Sensors


Preface:
Worst Sleeping Quality of my life
-- Actual Sleep was good, but sleep incidence was incredibly high
Very Anxiety Induced
Looked for external solutions. Melatonin, Unisom, Supplements, Chamomile tea, etc..
Lot's of getting up in the night.
Good mix of Insomnia and Normal Sleep data to analyze.

Things to track:
Total Sleep Length
Average Error of Sleep Tracker vs ground truth
Impact of Melatonin/Sleeping pills on Sleep
Quality of different sensors
Impact of Temp/Humidity/Sound on sleep quality
Impact of Alcohol on Sleep?

Things that I know its good at:
Tracking night sleep disruptions events
Tracking Severity of sleep disruption (multi sleep-event)

Open Questions:
Were Insomnia Nights marked by way more sleep events? -- Is it a good indicator?
How many false alarms? Too sensitive or the opposite?

Limitations:
Some missed night data, because of misconfigured sensors/server.
