Insomnia Event. In bed by 12:00am. Tossed and turned for countless hours. I never got up to check my phone,
so I'm not exactly sure when I did eventually fall in and out of sleep. At some point I noticed light in
my room again. In the end, I woke up at 12:17pm. Consumed a Unisom tablet at some point

Sleep Incidence: 180 min (at least)
Sleep Quality: 5 (slept well when I did finally sleep)
