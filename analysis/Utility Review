One of the things that bothers me the most when trying to fall asleep as an insomniac is checking my phone.
This sends me into a negative spiral that I struggle to recover from, as I calculate over and over in my
head how much sleep I'm going to get tonight, if I fall asleep right now. This keeps me anxious, alert, and not
sleepy. Anecdotally, I find nights where I don't check my phone while sleeping to be much more restful, and
even if it does take me a while to fall asleep, I do eventually fall asleep.

Therefore, the single greatest benefit of my passive sleep monitor for me has been being able to record sleep
disruption times without having to check my phone. It's pretty easy to notice spikes in activity, and match them
up with my memories of when I was getting up from bed or moving around.

Of all of the sleep event signalers, sound seems to be the most consisent and useful. This makes, sense, since
I'm definitely making noise when I'm getting up. Light is only a useful sleep event indicator if I have a severe
insomnia episode, such that I turn on my desk lamp. Still, this is maybe useful for auto-categorizing severe insomnia
data.
