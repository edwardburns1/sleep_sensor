Wanted to catch up on sleep, so i probably was in bed by 9:15. I took a Unisom, and then lied down,
 but didn't manage to fall asleep. I then took a melatonin supplement, and tried meditation.
 I then fell asleep. If I had to guess, this was sometime between 10 - 11pm (I was avoiding
 checking my phone). I then passed out until 11:15am the next day.
