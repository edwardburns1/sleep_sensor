Last night was a sleep disaster. I probably got into bed at around 11 - 11:15. I feel like I might've dozed off
but then I got up at 12:30, took a melatonin, did some push ups, and went back to bed. I wasn't getting sleepy
so I took another melatonin shortly thereafter. This also didn't work, so i laid in bed and tried getting up
and going to sleep all throughout the night. I tried all types of things. At a certain point I drank a beer,
hoping to trade sleep incidence for sleep quality. I also at some point I also took 2 more melatonin. At 4:45, I had completely given up hope, and I took a single
nyquil tablet. Soon thereafter, I fell fully asleep. I woke up naturally at 10:30, but then slept for another
hour until 11:30. I've noticed that temperature changes affect my initial sleep incidence heavily, and often cause
insomnia nights like this

Sleep Quality: 1
Sleep Incidence: 360 min
