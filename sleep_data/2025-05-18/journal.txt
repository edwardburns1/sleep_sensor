Went to bed around 11:15 to read for a bit, probably lights out around 11:30-40. It took me a little while to
fall asleep, and I got up at some point to use the bathroom and turn on my fan. My alarm went off at 8am, but I
probably got out of bed at 8:10 am.

Sleep Quality: 6
Sleep Onset Latency: 60 min
