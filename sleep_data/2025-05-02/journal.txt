First Sleep Journal with accompanying data. I went out to bars with my friends and got back late (consumed 1 alcoholic beverage), finally getting in bed around 2am.
It took me a while to fall asleep, and I eventually got up at 3am to use the bathroom and take a melatonin, before finally fully falling
asleep. I slept through the night without issue, waking up at 11:30 and finally getting out of bed around 11:50.
